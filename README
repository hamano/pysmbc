SMB bindings for Python
-----------------------

These Python bindings are intended to wrap the libsmbclient API.

Currently libsmbclient 3.2.x or later is required.


To build, simply use
 # make




Test
------
To run Python tests in tests/ you need python-nose
See nose documentation http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose

To run all the tests execute
# nosetests

To run just one test, use
# nosetests file.py

To selectively run test methods, printing output to console
# nosetests -vs  test_context.py:test_Workgroup


NOTE: to run your tests, you need 
 * a running samba server 
 * one shared folder with 
	* rw permissions
 	* guest ok = no
